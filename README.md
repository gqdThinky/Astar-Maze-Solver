# A* Maze Solver
A* Maze Solver is a Python application that uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path in a maze from the entrance to the exit. The program takes an input maze image in PNG format, where walls are represented in black and paths are represented in white, and calculates the optimal path using the A* algorithm.

# Features
    A Algorithm:* Utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the entrance to the exit of the maze.
    Interactive Interface: The program provides an interactive interface where you can visualize the maze solving process and save the solution as an image.
    User-Friendly: Simple user-experience allowing users to load their maze images and visualize the algorithm in action.

# How to Use
    Requirements:
        Python 3.x
        Required Python packages: pygame, heapq, os (install using pip install pygame heapq os)

    Usage:
        Place your maze image named maze.png in the same directory as the script.
        Run the pathfinder.py script using Python.
        Click on the "Save" button to save the solution path as maze_path.png.

# Getting Started
To get started with the A* Maze Solver, clone this repository to your local machine and make sure you have the required dependencies installed. Follow the instructions in the How to Use section to run the program and visualize the A* algorithm solving mazes.
